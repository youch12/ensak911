Developped application as part of a school assignement

## App idea

As part of ou senior year assignment, we decided to create an app beneficial to our school.

The idea is simple, it allows students to request documents from the administration, to do so, a student must submit a request.
On the other side, a user representing the administration, will approve or dismiss this request, 
providing him with a delivery date if all is good.

The app also allows students to get updates when new schedule (according to their major and school year) is put into place, or when an announcement is made, 
all this downloaded and done by the the administration representative.

Finally, the app also allows students to visualise on faculty members infos.

## Progress
So far only the user interfaces with basic functionalities are done, in addition distant access of mockable data on the site
**mockable.io", through the library **retrofit**. No real backend is implemented.

## Notes
For further infos and visualisation of the app architecture, check the source code.
